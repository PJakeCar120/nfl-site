  Lions: `NFL Draft Preview: #Lions
Picks: 28, 60, 102, 130, 196, 228, 244

Needs: OG, EDGE, ILB

OG: They lost Kevin Zeitler in FA this offseason. Graham Glasgow also had a down year in 2024. Glasgow, 32, has no guaranteed money in 2026 and likely won't be part of their long-term plans. 
They took Christian Mahogany in the 6th round last year and he looked good in very limited action.

EDGE: They released Za'Darius Smith. Josh Paschal returns as an option, but he had a weak year. They brought back Marcus Davenport on a $2.5M contract. They certainly need to add here.

ILB: Jack Campbell will be one of the starters here long-term. Alex Anzalone is 30 and his contract expires at the end of the year. They could look to replace him.

Outside of the needs above, they're loaded with star power at almost every position. They could also look to add a WR early. Some may point to CB, but they just paid Reed and drafted 
Arnold 24th and Rakestraw 61st last year. Arnold struggled, but truthfully he was put in a very tough spot for a rookie. They could also add to the IDL. D.J. Reader's contract expires at the 
end of the year.

Sample mock draft:
28. Nic Scourton, EDGE, Texas A&M
60. Alfred Collins, DT, Texas
102. Jackson Slater, OG, Sacramento State`,

  Commanders: `NFL Draft Preview: #Commanders
Picks: 29, 61, 128, 205, 245

Needs: OT, OG, EDGE, S

OT: Wylie is a weak starter. At 31 years old, his contract expires at the end of the season. How Washington sees Coleman will affect this.

OG: Allegretti is a below-average starter. He's 29 years old, and just signed with Washington for 3 years, $16M last year. He has no guaranteed money in 2026.

EDGE: This may be the weakest EDGE room in the entire NFL. Armstrong is a fine starter. Outside of him they essentially have nothing. They better address the position early.

S: They lost Chinn (1209 snaps) and didn't bring in a legitimate replacement. They'll have to add someone here.

Pick 29: Offensive line or defensive line. I'll say it for most teams, but especially in Washington's case they badly need it. Wylie and Allegretti aren't terrible, but they aren't long-term 
solutions either – Is Coleman? The EDGE room is terrible.

Pick 61: More of the same. They need to add to the lines. They could look S here too. If they go EDGE R1, I could also see them adding a weapon here for Daniels. He loves Ertz, but Ertz is 34. 
That will also depend on Sinnott's development. Deebo may only be a one-year stopgap as well, so WR is in play. Even RB is possible if someone slips.

Sample mock draft:
29: Mike Green, EDGE, Marshall
61. Marcus Mbow, OG, Purdue`,

  Bills: `NFL Draft Preview: #Bills
Picks: 30, 56, 62, 109, 132, 169, 170, 173, 177, 206

Needs: WR, OG, DT, CB, S

WR: 854 vacated snaps from Mack Hollins, 319 vacated from Amari Cooper. They added Josh Palmer, and Keon Coleman should get a boost this season. Still, the group could use help on the outside.

OG: David Edwards' 2 year $6M contract expires at the end of the year. He's fine, but an improvement would be nice.

DT: DaQuan Jones was fine last season, but an impact guy to pair with Oliver would really help out this team. They added Ogunjobi, but that's really a rotational piece. Both guys' deals 
expire at the end of the season.

CB: 996 vacated snaps from Rasul Douglas. They didn't really address the hole in free agency. This is a pretty glaring need.

S: Both starters, Hamlin and Rapp, return. Both are on cheap deals, so it'd be nice to at least add some competition. They also took Bishop 60th last year, so a mid-round pick would 
probably suffice.

Since 2015, the Bills have selected the following positions in the 1st round: EDGE, CB, QB, ILB, DT, EDGE, CB, TE. Compared to other teams, they're more willing to draft 
non-premium positions.

Pick 30: "Needs" aside, the Bills have one of the top QBs in the NFL. They can trust Josh Allen to support an elite offense with what he currently has. Thus, we turn to the 
defensive side of the ball. This first round pick should probably be defensive line. I think they have a bigger need at DT than EDGE, but I could see either. CB or S is an option as well, 
but they just invested a lot of money in Benford and S in the first-round is questionable positional-value wise.

Picks 56, 62: Any of the needs work here. They have a lot of options and can go pseudo-BPA. They could also theoretically trade Cook and go RB here if contract negotiations go south.

Sample mock draft:
30. Walter Nolen, DT, Ole Miss
56. Darien Porter, CB, Iowa State
62. Tate Ratledge, OG, Georgia`,

  Chiefs: `NFL Draft Preview: #Chiefs
Picks: 31, 63, 66, 95, 133, 226, 251, 257

Needs:

RB: Clear weak spot

OT: Both Moore and Taylor have contracts the Chiefs can get out of relatively easily following the season.

OG: Kingsley was drafted 63rd last season and is still just 22 years old. I'd like to see them give him a shot here.

DT: Need a replacement for Wharton
S: Reid departed, but it seems the team is confident in Jaden Hicks, who looked very strong in 330 snaps last season

Since 2015, the Chiefs have selected the following positions in the 1st round: CB, QB, RB, CB, EDGE, EDGE, WR.

Pick 31: I'd expect either OL or IDL. They could take OG, but I'd like to see Kingsley get his shot. That leaves us with OT and IDL. Either would be very justifiable.

Picks 63, 66: Presumably, they'll have taken one of OT or IDL. That leaves them with holes at OT/IDL and RB. They could also look to add an EDGE here. I'd love to see them add an explosive back 
to pair with Pacheco's power. If they go OT round 1, they really need to add IDL here as well.

Sample mock draft:
31. Derrick Harmon, DT, Oregon
63. JT Tuimoloau, EDGE, Ohio State
66. Darien Porter, CB, Iowa State
95. Dylan Sampson, RB, Tennessee`,

  Eagles: `NFL Draft Preview: #Eagles
Draft Picks: 32, 64, 96, 134, 161, 164, 165, 168

Needs: WR3, TE (if Goedert moved), OG, DE, EDGE, CB, S

At each of these needs, the Eagles have young, unproven players (WR Dotson, OGs Steen, Green, DE Ojomo, EDGEs Hunt, Ojulari, Huff, CB Ringo, S Brown).

Over the next month, you will see a lot of mock drafts with the Eagles taking S. Here are the Eagles 1st round picks since 2015: WR, QB, DE, OT, WR, WR, DT, DE, EDGE, CB. So, don't 
hold your breath.

Pick 32: If they don't trade back, which is likely, I'd expect this to be used on either OL or DL. On OL, the team could look to take an OT and convert him to OG,
or just take an OG. With the rise in OG contracts, it has become a position "worthy" of selecting in the 1st-round from a salary cap standpoint. On DL, the team 
could look for either a DE or EDGE. CB is also "worthy" of 
being selected from a salary cap standpoint, but with Mitchell and DeJean playing at such a high level it may be a bit excessive for a first-round pick.

Pick 64 and on: The board opens up now. Eagles 2nd round picks since 2015: CB, CB, TE, RB, WR, QB, OG, C, NB. The team seemingly starts to prioritize their draft board over positional value here.

The Eagles excel at not having any "massive" needs heading into the draft. This year, there are probably a couple more question marks than normal.

2024 Snaps by "Needs":

WR3 Dotson: 674
OG Steen: 315, Green: 592
DE Ojomo: 388
EDGE Hunt: 240, Ojulari: 391, Huff: 285
CB Ringo: 113
S Brown: 80 (2023: 334)

While the team has some young question marks, it should remain incredibly strong with superstar talent throughout the roster.

Sample mock draft:
32. Donovan Ezeiruaku, EDGE, Boston College
64. Omarr Norman-Lott, DT, Tennessee
96. Jaylen Reed, S, Penn State `,

  Ravens: `NFL Draft Preview: #Ravens
Picks: 27, 59, 91, 129, 136, 176, 183, 203, 210, 212, 243

Needs: WR, OG, DLine, ILB, CB

WR: Nelson Agholor vacates 466 snaps. They signed DeAndre Hopkins to a 1 year $5M deal, but long-term they need a replacement on the outside.

OG: They're pretty weak at both spots here after losing Patrick Mekari.

DLine: No team rotates defensive line quite like the Ravens. They have 2 studs at IDL with 27 year-old Madubuike (my #14/102 qualifying IDL) and 25 year-old Jones (#33/102). 
They played Broderick Washington 490 snaps and he graded as my #84/102 IDL, so an improvement there would be nice. EDGE-wise, 34 year-old Van Noy (#29/115) and Oweh (#30/115) both had strong years. 
Tavius Robinson (#101/115) played 548 snaps, so some competition would be nice. Of course, Baltimore could just be more restrictive with their snaps next season.

ILB: Some competition for Trenton Simpson would be nice after they benched him late last season.

CB: Last year's rookie Nate Wiggins had a fantastic rookie year (my #19/116 CBs), so he'll be a strength. Marlon Humphrey will man the nickel, and they'll need a replacement at outside CB 
for Brandon Stephens' 1135 vacated snaps. They signed 30 year-old Chidobe Awuzie in free agency so they have a competent option, but surely they'll be looking for something more long-term. 
Also important to remember they play in a division with Chase, Higgins, Metcalf, Pickens, and Jeudy.

First Round Pick History under Eric DeCosta: WR, ILB, WR, EDGE, S, C, WR, CB

Quick note: I see a lot of sites with Safety listed as a need. I had 25 year-old Ar'Darius Washington as my #30 ranked S last year, so I disagree pretty strongly on that front.

Sample mock draft:
27. Shavon Revel, CB, East Carolina
59. Jonah Savaiinaea, OG, Arizona
91. Kyle Kennard, EDGE, South Carolina`,

Rams: `NFL Draft Preview: #Rams
Picks: 26, 90, 101, 127, 190, 195, 201, 202

Needs: TE, OT, EDGE, ILB, CB

TE: 32 year-old Tyler Higbee's contract expires after this season. Colby Parkinson has no guaranteed money after this season, as well. 

OT: Preferential decision here. They just locked up Alaric Jackson long-term. 32 year-old Rob Havenstein's contract expires after this season, but he's still playing at a high level. 
They could extend Havenstein or opt to look for a new, long-term solution. 

EDGE: Michael Hoecht left in Free Agency, vacating 705 snaps. They haven't brought in anyone to replace him. 

ILB: Christian Rozeboom left in Free Agency, vacating 956 snaps. They replaced him with Nate Landman, but this is quite a weak group with Landman and Speights. 

CB: I happen to be higher on this CB group than most, ranking Darious Williams 37th and Cobie Durant 14th among CBs in 2024. Still, the 32 year-old Williams has no guaranteed money past 
this season and Ahkello Witherspoon, who played 599 snaps last season, was my 86th ranked CB. 

First Round Pick History under Les Snead: EDGE, WR, ILB, OT, IDL, RB, QB, EDGE

Sample mock draft:
26. Josh Simmons, OT, Ohio State
90. Jacob Parrish, CB, Kansas State
101. Jared Ivey, EDGE, Ole Miss`,

Texans: `NFL Draft Preview: #Texans
Picks: 25, 58, 79, 89, 166, 236, 241

Needs: RB, WR, OL, IDL

RB: Joe Mixon is already 28 and has no guaranteed money in 2026. They could look to add a backup this season to eventually take over. 

WR: Outside of Nico Collins, the future of the WR room is very much in doubt. Christian Kirk's contract expires following this season, and we don't know when or even if Tank Dell will be healthy 
again. For this season, they'll need another outside WR with Collins being one and Kirk in the slot. 

OL: Given Tytus Howard and Juice Scruggs' abilities to play multiple positions, this is a sort of "combo need" for Houston. With that being said, here is how I see the Texans' most optimal path 
forward at OL: draft good players. Cam Robinson, Tytus Howard, Blake Fisher, and Juice Scruggs are all passable starters. 

IDL: I'm a big fan of the veteran IDL on Houston, with my model having the following ranks among IDL: Rankins #26, Settle #27, and Edwards #34. Still, all 3 are on the older side with contracts 
expiring this year except for Edwards on a two-year deal. 

First Round Pick History under Nick Caserio: CB, OG, QB, EDGE

Mock Draft:
25. Josh Simmons, OT, Ohio State
58. Tate Ratledge, OG, Georgia
79. Shemar Turner, DT, Texas A&M
89. Savion Williams, WR, TCU

Possible starting OL with this mock draft: 
LT: Cam Robinson
LG: Tytus Howard
C: Juice Scruggs
RG: Tate Ratledge
RT: Josh Simmons

Blake Fisher could also start over Cam Robinson, with Simmons at LT and Fisher at RT.`,

Vikings: `NFL Draft Preview: #Vikings
Picks: 24, 97, 139, 187

Needs: OG, IDL, S

OG: Blake Brandel really struggled last season. An improvement would be hugely beneficial. This is the only significant need on offense.

IDL: Harrison Phillips has no guaranteed money after this season and has struggled the past few years, ranking #78 among IDL in my model in 2024.

S: Camryn Bynum walked, vacating 1060 snaps. They don’t currently have a replacement unless they shuffle the secondary around to leave a hole at outside CB or Nickel. I’m assuming that they will 
keep Murphy Jr. on the outside this year, however.

Note: Many will point to CB as a need. I had Isaiah Rodgers, who was very solid in limited reps, as my #43 CB last season. I think he’ll be solid in the CB2 role this year.

First Round Pick History under Kwesi Adofo-Mensah: S, WR, QB, EDGE

I don’t attempt to predict draft day trades, but I do think it would make a lot of sense for Minnesota to move down this year.

Mock Draft:
24. Nick Emmanwori, S, South Carolina
97. Deone Walker, IDL, Kentucky`,

Packers: `NFL Draft Preview: #Packers
Picks: 23, 54, 87, 124, 159, 198, 237, 250

Needs: WR, IDL, EDGE, CB

WR: Jayden Reed graded out as my #26 WR last season, so he’ll confidently man the slot next season. However, they’re weak on the outside. Christian Watson was my #25, but he’ll likely miss time 
and has generally struggled to stay on the field. Romeo Doubs was my #35, and Dontayvion Wicks struggled, ranking #63. They have depth here, but they could use a more dominant outside WR.

IDL: The Packers are still looking for a more consistent piece next to Kenny Clark. Personally, I like Devonte Wyatt, who graded as my #16 DT in 2023 and didn’t play enough in 2024 to qualify. 
Unfortunately, the Packers don’t seem as convinced as I am.

EDGE: Another place where they are looking for more consistency across from Rashan Gary. Kingsley Enagbare graded as my #80 EDGE last season, and Lukas Van Ness was my #86 EDGE, so I 
wouldn’t hold my breath on a breakout season.

CB: I’m going to make the safe assumption that Jaire Alexander will not be a Packer next season. That leaves the Packers with Keisean Nixon and Carrington Valentine on the outside. I’m actually 
a big fan of both, with Nixon as my #22 CB last season and Valentine as my #27. Still, they’ll want to add another guy here.

First Round Pick History under Brian Gutekunst: CB, EDGE, S, QB, CB, ILB, IDL, EDGE, OG

Sample Mock Draft:
23. Walter Nolen, IDL, Ole Miss
54. J.T. Tuimoloau, EDGE, Ohio State

Chargers: `NFL Draft Preview: #Chargers
Picks: 22, 55, 86, 125, 158, 181, 199, 209, 214, 256

Needs: RB, WR, IOL, IDL, EDGE

RB: The Chargers thrive on running the ball, so they’ll want to add a compliment and successor to Najee Harris. Luckily, this is a deep draft, so they’ll have plenty of options.

WR: Slot WR Ladd McConkey will be their top target again next year. Quentin Johnston showed massive improvement this season, going from my #91 WR as a rookie to #22 this year. Still, they’ll 
need another Outside WR after vacating 616 snaps from Josh Palmer.

IOL: The Chargers could opt to find a long-term replacement for Bradley Bozeman. Because Zion Johnson has the ability to move to Center, this means they could draft either a Center or Guard.

IDL: This group could use a lot of work. The projected starters ranked the following in my model last season among IDL: Da’Shawn Hand #71, Teair Tart #44, Otito Ogbonnia #81. Furthermore, not a 
single one is signed past this season. I think this is by far the weakest position group on the team.

EDGE: Joey Bosa left in Free Agency, vacating 502 snaps. They haven’t added a replacement, so they’ll need another rotational EDGE at some point.

The Chargers could also add a TE or CB early. Really, they’re looking at straight BPA. For a playoff team, they have quite a few holes.

First Round Pick History under Joe Hortiz: OT

Sample Mock Draft:
22. Kenneth Grant, IDL, Michigan
55. TreVeyon Henderson, RB, Ohio State
86. Kyle Kennard, EDGE, South Carolina`,

Steelers: `NFL Draft Preview: #Steelers
Picks: 21, 83, 123, 156, 185, 229

Needs: QB, RB, OG, IDL

QB: Their Quarterback next season may very well be Aaron Rodgers, but regardless he was my #17 rated QB last season and is already 41 years old.

RB: Najee Harris left in Free Agency, vacating 590 snaps. Backup Jaylen Warren was my #48 rated RB last season.

OG: Mason McCormick is very replaceable as a starter, while Isaac Seumalo’s contract expires at the end of the season.

IDL: Larry Ogunjobi left in Free Agency, vacating 549 snaps. They’ll need a replacement to join a very strong interior with Cameron Heyward, my #1 rated IDL last season, and Keeanu Benton, 
my #42 rated IDL last season.

First Round Pick History under Omar Khan: OT, CB, OT

Sample Mock Draft:
21. Jaxson Dart, QB, Ole Miss
83. Omarr Norman-Lott, IDL, Tennessee`,

Broncos: `NFL Draft Preview: Broncos
Picks: 20, 51, 85, 122, 191, 197, 208

Needs: RB, WR, TE, ILB, CB

RB: Their current RB room has last year’s 5th-round pick Audric Estime and the pass-catching Jaleel McLaughlin. Sean Payton’s scheme relies heavily on the run game, and he’s spoken at length about 
wanting to add a dynamic RB.

WR: Outside of the talented Courtland Sutton, my WR20 last season, they’re currently relying on last year’s rookie pair of Troy Franklin and Devaughn Vele. I figured they’d add a veteran, and they 
still can, but as of now this is a need.

TE: Sean Payton loves an impactful Tight End. They signed Evan Engram, but I’m sure Payton would like a more long-term solution at the position.

ILB: They have some question marks here with Greenlaw and Singleton. Neither player has any guaranteed money after this season, so they’ll need to prepare for the future here.

CB: While they have likely the top CB in the NFL in Pat Surtain, we must follow the advice of @ericeager_ with respect to weak-link systems. Riley Moss finished the season as my CB63,
while Nickel Ja’Quan McMillian was my CB80. They could look to add competition here.

Buccaneers: `NFL Draft Preview: Buccanneers
Picks: 19, 53, 84, 121, 157, 235

Needs: TE, EDGE, ILB, S

TE: The Bucs ran a fair bit of 12 personnel last season. Otton’s contract expires at the end of the season, so some added clarity at the position may help.

EDGE: Despite his lack of sacks, I was very happy with Yaya Diaby’s performance in 2024 (my #15 EDGE). Opposite him this season will be Haason Reddick, but they’ll need a long-term answer.

ILB: While Lavonte David may actually be immortal, let’s assume he’s not. I have Anthony Walker Jr, my #63 ILB in 2024, projected to start alongside him. They’ll really want to look towards 
the future here. They’ll likely be replacing both starters in the next 2 years.

S: Christian Izien really struggled last year, coming in as my #64 ranked safety. I’d like to see them give him at least fairly strong competition.

I happen to be much higher on both Buccaneers CBs than most. Provided they still healthy, I think a combination of Zyon McCollum and Jamel Dean is very strong. To me there are other, more 
glaring issues on the defense. I’m sure they’ll add depth, though, with the injury concerns with Dean.

Seahawks: `NFL Draft Preview: Seahawks 
Picks: 18, 50, 52, 82, 92, 137, 172, 175, 223, 234

Needs: WR, TE, OT, OG, ILB, S

WR: Seattle doesn’t have a clear #1 outside WR. Regardless of how they use JSN and Kupp, they’ll need a future perimeter #1.

TE: Noah Fant’s contract expires following the season. They may bring him back, or they may opt to restart at the position.

OT: With Abraham Lucas an upcoming FA, the Seahawks will want to find a better, more long-term option.

OG: It’s never ideal when both OT and OG are needs, but here we are. They’re likely still looking for both starting OGs long-term.

ILB: Tyrice Knight started 11 games last season as a rookie. He played about as expected for a rookie, so I don’t see this as a huge need. They may look for some depth here or competition 
for Knight, but they have more pressing needs.

S: Coby Bryant’s contract expires after the season, so they’ll have an interesting decision here. I thought he played very well last year, grading as my #23 Safety in his only year as a starter.

Bengals: `NFL Draft Preview: Bengals 
Picks: 17, 49, 81, 119, 153, 193

Needs: WR, OG, IDL, EDGE, CB, S

WR: I know, I know, they have Ja’Marr Chase (my #3 WR in 2024) and Tee Higgins (#10). Still, they need a legit third WR.

OG: Neither current starting OG is signed to starter money or really starter level.

IDL: The Bengals are actually relatively deep here, they just lack a true #1. B.J. Hill (my #30 IDL in 2024), Kris Jenkins (my #87), and T.J. Slaton (my #74) can all eat snaps, but they need a 
long-term leader for this group.

EDGE: Outside of the fantastic Trey Hendrickson (my #4 EDGE in 2024) this position group is really thin. Joseph Ossai, my #77 EDGE in 2024, currently projects as the 2nd starter.

CB: Before injury, DJ Turner was playing some really strong football. Cam Taylor-Britt struggled, but you could argue it was in large part an effect of the weak pass-rush. This group may be 
better than we give credit, so I could see Cincinnati focusing on other needs.

S: Geno Stone was solid, though his contract expires after the season. His counterpart Jordan Battle has yet to start for a full season. At the very least, they need to add some depth. 
There’s essentially no certainty at the position past this season.

Sample Mock Draft:
17. Derrick Harmon, IDL, Oregon  
49. Landon Jackson, EDGE, Arkansas  
81. Kevin Winston Jr, S, Penn State`,

Cardinals: `NFL Draft Preview: Cardinals 
Picks: 16, 47, 78, 115, 152, 225

Needs: WR, OT, OG, IDL, EDGE

WR: Outside of Marvin Harrison Jr, this is a relatively weak group. Michael Wilson ranked as my #86 WR in 2024, while Greg Dortch was #81.

OT: Jonah Williams is a free agent following the season, so they may opt for a long-term improvement.

OG: Isaiah Adams struggled a bit as a rookie, but the 3rd-round pick is just starting to get his bearing in the NFL. I could easily see Arizona roll with him as a starter next season. 
Evan Brown has been solid but has a replaceable contract.

IDL: They could definitely use some youth in this group. Outside of Darius Robinson, we’re looking at 31 year-old Dalvin Tomlinson and 39 year old Calais Campbell. The group is strong this year, 
but they’ll need to add some young talent.

EDGE: A rotation of Zaven Collins, my #48 EDGE last season, and Baron Browning, my #69 EDGE last season, isn’t as bad as some make it out to be. Still, a more consistent long-term starter would be ideal.

I’m fine with their starters at ILB: 28 year-old Akeem Davis-Gaither (my #49 ILB) and 27 year-old Mack Wilson (my #61 ILB) are both signed through 2026. In my opinion, a late depth pick would suffice.

Falcons: `NFL Draft Preview: Falcons 
Picks: 15, 46, 118, 218, 242

Needs: WR, IDL, EDGE, CB, S

WR: Outside of the fantastic duo of Drake London (my WR15) and Darnell Mooney (WR27), the Falcons are thin at WR. A late-round pick would do, but they should add another option, preferably 
a slot.

IDL: Other than Ruke Orhorhoro, there may not be a player from this group on the roster next season. This is a huge target for them early.

EDGE: Similar to IDL, there isn’t much of a future on the EDGE. The Falcons should be targeting DLine hard this draft.

CB: Weak-link systems. Dee Alford got crushed last year, so they’d really benefit from an improvement at Nickel.

S: The Falcons haven’t yet done anything to replace Justin Simmons and Richie Grant who both walked this offseason. Jordan Fuller struggled last year after a strong 2023 season.

Colts: `NFL Draft Preview: Colts
Picks: 14, 45, 80, 117, 151, 189, 232

Needs: TE, OG, IDL, ILB

TE: The Colts have seemingly wanted to add an elite TE for years now and it just hasn’t happened. Regardless, this is a strong draft for the position.

OG: Will Fries departed in free agency and they haven’t really done anything to fill the spot.

IDL: With DeForest Buckner 31 years-old and Grover Stewart 32, the Colts will need to prepare for life after one or both of them.

ILB: The Colts will need to replace E.J. Speed. Last year’s 5th-round pick Jaylon Carlies is the frontrunner, but they may replace him in the draft.

Cowboys: `NFL Draft Preview: Cowboys
Picks: 12, 44, 76, 149, 174, 204, 211, 217, 239, 247

Needs: RB, WR, OG, EDGE, NB

RB: It’s hard to imagine the Cowboys without a star RB, but the truth is they haven’t invested in this position quite as strongly as the general sentiment holds. They’ll probably add at some 
point, but I don’t think it’s a major concern.

WR: Outside of CeeDee Lamb, it’s pretty bleak. KaVontae Turpin actually had a pretty good year (my #66 WR) but regardless they’ll want to add.

OG: Zack Martin retired and leaves a hall-of-fame sized hole. As of now, I have Robert Jones projected to start at that spot.

EDGE: Dante Fowler Jr. graded out very well for me last season as my #36 ranked EDGE. Still, he’s 31 years-old and only signed for one year.

NB: Nickel Jourdan Lewis walked for a huge payday this offseason. They’ll need a replacement at some point.

Needs: OG, IDL, EDGE, ILB, CB

OG: Aaron Banks walked this offseason and no replacement has been brought in.

IDL: The biggest weakness on the team. They don’t have an IDL signed past this season. Jordan Elliott and Kevin Givens would be the likely starters as of now.

EDGE: Outside of Bosa, there are no EDGEs signed past this season. The focus of this draft will certainly be on the defensive line. Yetur Gross-Matos is the 2nd starter as of now.

ILB: De’Vondre Campbell walked, leaving a hole next to the legendary Fred Warner. Dee Winters is the 2nd starter as of now.

CB: With Charvarius Ward gone, they will need to add here. They’ll need an outside Corner.

Bears: `NFL Draft Preview: Bears
Picks: 10, 39, 41, 72, 148, 233, 240

Needs: RB, TE, EDGE, ILB, CB

RB: Head Coach Ben Johnson uses the run game to set up the full offense. They’ll want an improvement over current RB D’Andre Swift, my #35 RB last season.

TE: Johnson ran a fair bit of 12 personnel last season, so they’ll likely want to improve at the 2nd TE slot.

EDGE: Dayo Odeyingbo is likely to be the 2nd starter here, but his new contract is more projection than anything, ranking as my #55 EDGE last season (#52 in 2023, #82 in 2022).

ILB: With no guaranteed money left on his deal in 2026, Tremaine Edmunds seems unlikely to be on the roster past this year.

CB: Tyrique Stevenson has ranked as my #71 CB each of the past two seasons, so an improvement at the 2nd CB spot would be ideal.

People have seemingly talked themselves into OT being a need. While I will never fully disagree with investing in the lines, I do have to disagree here. Braxton Jones is an above-average 
starting OT and 26 years-old. Darnell Wright was fantastic last year at 23 years-old.

At Safety, I think a depth pick would suffice. Brisker, while injury prone, was very good last year when healthy. Kevin Byard had a resurgent year, ranking as my #11 S. With the general 
inconsistency at this position league-wide, I don't think they should be investing heavy resources here.

Saints: `NFL Draft Preview: Saints 
Picks: 9, 40, 71, 93, 112, 131, 184, 248, 254

Needs: QB, WR, OT, OG, IDL, CB

QB: Truthfully, I’m the world’s biggest Derek Carr fan. I had him as my #5 QB in 2024 and #7 in 2023. Regardless, the Derek Carr Era is over in New Orleans. The Saints will cut bait next 
offseason rather than pay an extra $50M for 2026.

WR: This isn’t a massive need currently, but both Olave and Shaheed have murky futures in NO. The team still has Olave’s 5th-year option, while Shaheed is an UFA following the season.

OT: It feels like the Trevor Penning experience may have run its course. For a team likely to struggle again next year, giving the former first-rounder another year as a starter isn’t the 
worst idea. Still, it seems unlikely he’ll be the guy long-term.

OG: Right now, I have Dillon Radunz projected as the 2nd starter at OG. He just signed a one year, $2.25M contract, so that’s really just a stopgap. They’ll need a long-term solution.

IDL: Outside of Bryan Bresee, who ranked #51 among IDL for me last season, they don’t really have anyone. Khalen Saunders projects to start, but he wont be the long-term answer.

CB: The good news is Kool-Aid McKinstry was solid as a rookie last season. Outside of him, though, they don’t have much. Isaac Yiadom projects to start opposite him, while Alontae Taylor, 
who really struggled last year, will be the Nickel.

Panthers: `NFL Draft Preview: Panthers 
Picks: 8, 57, 74, 111, 114, 140, 146, 163, 230
  
Needs: WR, EDGE, ILB, CB, S
  
WR: Jalen Coker had a fantastic rookie year, finishing as my #49 WR on the season but really heating up late. Adam Thielen had a good year as well, though at 35 he won’t be a part of the 
long-term plan. Xavier Legette also deserves time. Still, they need a dominant WR1, and I’m not to sure that is currently on the roster.
  
EDGE: D.J. Wonnum and Jadeveon Clowney each graded out well for me last year, ranking 23rd and 28th, respectively. Wonnum is 28 and an upcoming free agent, while Clowney is 32 and an 
upcoming free agent. So, there’s lots of uncertainty here. Wonnum will be a part of the long-term plans, but they’ll need a Clowney replacement.
  
ILB: Carolina is likely looking for 2 long-term starters here. Josey Jewell is 30 with no guaranteed money past this season, while Trevin Wallace is a question mark.
  
CB: CB2 Mike Jackson graded as my #45 CB last season, so he may be a little stronger than public perception. Nevertheless, they’ll look to improve long-term. They don’t have a consistent 
presence at Nickel, so they’ll look to add there.
  
S: Borderline need here. If the Panthers are comfortable rolling with 2024 undrafted-rookie Demani Richardson then I am too. He played pretty well in limited snaps last season.
  
Sample Mock Draft:
8. Tet McMillan, WR, Arizona

Jets: `NFL Draft Preview: Jets
Picks: 7, 42, 73, 110, 145, 162, 186, 207

Needs: QB, WR, TE, OT, IDL, S

QB: I know there are many Justin Fields “truthers” but I just don’t think he’ll ever be the guy. He ranked as my QB19 in 2023, QB29 in 2022, and QB27 in 2021.

WR: Outside of Garrett Wilson, it’s bleak. I’m hoping we get to see Malachi Corley start in the slot this year, but regardless they need a lot of help here.

TE: They really don’t have anything here. Jeremy Ruckert projects to start but he doesn’t even qualify for my model.

OT: The good news: they have a 23 year-old, selected 11th last year, locked in as one of the starters. They really have no options on the other side, and my expectation is that this is where 
they’ll use pick #7.

IDL: Behind Quinnen Williams (my #8 IDL in 2024) they are very thin. I project Byron Cowart to start, but that’s just a placeholder.

S: Both starting Safeties are upcoming free agents and struggled somewhat in 2024. They’re both young, and really could both be long-term solutions, but there’s not a lot of stability in the 
position group moving forward.

Sample Mock Draft:
7. Armand Membou, OT, Missouri
42. Luther Burden III, WR, Missouri

Raiders: `NFL Draft Preview: Raiders
Picks: 6, 37, 68, 108, 143, 180, 213, 215, 222

Needs: QB, RB, WR, IDL, ILB, CB, S

QB: Geno Smith is 35 and trending in the wrong direction according to my model (2024 26th, 2023 15th, 2022 13th). He has no guaranteed money in 2027, so they could theoretically look towards 
the future here.

RB: They have very little on the roster right now RB-wise. It’s a very deep draft at the position, so they’ll be alright here. They may just draft Ashton Jeanty and call it a day – I won’t do 
so in this mock draft.

WR: Outside of the ever-consistent Jakobi Meyers, the Raiders don’t have much here. Of course, Brock Bowers is essentially a WR, and a very good one at that.

IDL: Outside of Christian Wilkins, they’re pretty thin here. I’m sure they’d love to beef up the interior to make Maxx Crosby’s job a little easier.

ILB: They’re scrapping at parts here with Elandon Roberts and Devin White. Neither is signed past this season, so they’re looking for two long-term starters.

CB: While I am the world’s biggest Jakorian Bennett (my #26 CB last season), they have very little behind him. They’ll definitely want to address the position.

S: Isaiah Pola-Mao was thrust into a starter role last season and struggled. He won’t kill them, but long-term they’ll need a better solution.

While I’m always a general proponent of trading down for future picks, If I were the Raiders I would REALLY want to trade back. 6 is an awkward spot for them and they have a ton of holes to 
fill.

Sample Mock Draft:
6. Tet McMillan, WR, Arizona
37. Shavon Revel, CB, East Carolina

Jaguars: `NFL Draft Preview: Jaguars
Picks: 5, 36, 70, 88, 107, 126, 142, 182, 194, 221

Needs: RB, WR, CB, S

RB: At this point, we know Etienne isn’t the future. They’ll want to improve here, but it’s not necessarily a massive need.

WR: Brian Thomas is a superstar, ranking as my WR11 as a rookie. That makes everything else a lot easier. They could definitely improve from Dyami Brown and Parker Washington, but if they opt 
not to they aren’t in a terrible position by any means necessary.

CB: Outside of Tyson Campbell they are very thin on the outside. I project Montaric Brown, my #89 CB last season, to start. This is a big spot for improvement.

S: Darnell Savage has really struggled the past 4 years according to my model, ranking #82, #86, #82, and #70. They can easily get out of his contract after this season, which I expect they 
will. Eric Murray had a strong 2024, but he’s still 31 years-old and making borderline starter money.

I don’t believe OT is necessarily a need, yet I choose Armand Membou here in my mock. The Jaguars need to unlock Trevor Lawrence, so let’s turn a somewhat “fine” OT room into an elite one. 
I see the argument for Mason Graham as well, though I would like to see Maason Smith in a bigger role and a combination of Arik Armstead and DaVon Hamilton should be a strong #2. I do not see 
the argument for Ashton Jeanty.

Overall, this is a very strong roster for a 4-13 team. In a weaker division, they may be ready to compete right away.

Sample Mock Draft:
5. Armand Membou, OT, Missouri
36. Maxwell Hairston, CB, Kentucky
70. Kevin Winston Jr, S, Penn State
88. Dylan Sampson, RB, Tennessee`,

Patriots: `NFL Draft Preview: Patriots
Picks: 4, 38, 69, 77, 106, 144, 171, 220, 238

Needs: RB, WR, OT, IOL, EDGE

RB: While they have bigger issues, I don’t see Rhamondre Stevenson as a starting-level RB (#38 in 2024, #36 in 2023). They can get out of his contract easily after 2026.

WR: Outside of Stefon Diggs, the room is very unproven. Kayshon Boutte was my #60 WR last season, while Pop Douglas was #78. That’s not terrible for young guys, and we can’t give up on 
Ja’Lynn Polk after one season. Still, there’s reason for concern with this group.

OT: They really have to add an OT with one of the top 2 picks. Drake Maye needs to be protected and the current setup won’t do that.

IOL: The current lineup at OG and C will be fine for this season, but outside of Onwenu they don’t have any long-term options.

EDGE: They aren’t particularly weak here, they just aren’t very strong either. Landry and White are both solid EDGES but they’ll want to find a true #1 at some point.

The theme of this draft will be helping to protect Drake Maye. The offensive line and receiver room simply aren’t good enough. On the other side of the ball, I really like what they’ve put 
together. The pairing of Milton Williams and Christian Barmore should be super strong. The secondary likely has above-average starters at each position. At linebacker, Robert Spillane was my 
#10 ILB in 2024 and #6 in 2023. If they draft well this year, and Drake Maye is as good as I think he’ll eventually be, this team is really looking up.

Giants: `NFL Draft Preview: Giants
Picks: 3, 34, 65, 99, 105, 154, 219, 246

Needs: QB, TE, OT, OG, IDL

QB: I’m a Russell Wilson fan, my model ranking him QB7 last season. Still, he’s not the future and they likely will not be contenders this season.

TE: In a strong TE draft class, the Giants could certainly add here. The current group is underwhelming.

OT: 31 year-old Jermaine Eluemunor’s contract expires after the season. They’ll want to add a more long-term starter.

OG: I have 35 year-old Greg Van Roten projected as the 2nd starter at OG. Similar to OT, they’ll want to find a more long-term starter.

IDL: Neither Rakeem Nunez-Roches nor Roy Robertson-Harris is making over $5M AAV. They need a full overhaul of this group outside of star NT Dexter Lawrence.

At CB, Deonte Banks probably deserves one more year. He has solid his rookie season but dreadful last year. The additions of Paulson Adebo and Jevon Holland should make his life a lot easier. 
The EDGE room is relatively strong, but the opportunity to draft such a premier player in Abdul Carter is too much to pass up.

Browns: `NFL Draft Preview: Browns
Picks: 2, 33, 67, 94, 104, 179, 192, 200, 216, 255

Needs: QB, RB, WR, OT, EDGE, CB, S

QB: It will be interesting to see how Cleveland approaches the position this draft. It appears they won’t be selecting one with the 2nd pick, so pick 33 or a trade back into the first become 
interesting options.

RB: Jerome Ford ranked as my #20 RB in 2024, so this isn’t as big of a need to me. Cleveland isn’t really in a position to invest in RB anyway, so I’d be happy to see them stick with Ford or a 
late-round pick.

WR: Jerry Jeudy really turned it on late last season, though the raw volume of passing from Jameis Winston certainly helped. Outside of him, the group is pretty weak. The expectation is that 
Cleveland will draft Travis Hunter and use him as a WR, so they may have found their solution.

OT: Former fourth-round pick Dawand Jones struggled last season after a better 2023. Jack Conklin has maintained a solid level of play, but after agreeing to a contract restructure this 
offseason in which he shortened his contract to end after 2025 it seems his time with the Browns is ending.

EDGE: The Browns have the best EDGE rusher in the NFL. Behind him, though, they are a little thin. Isaiah McGuire performed very well last season, but a larger sample size will tell us more. 
They’ll hope to revitalize the career of Joe Tryon-Shoyinka as a depth piece.

CB: Martin Emerson Jr. really struggled last season after a strong 2023. His contract expires after the season, so they’ll want to add some flexibility at the position. It appears that Nickel 
Greg Newsome II is on his way out, too. His contract expires after the season.

S: With Rodney McLeod Jr. and Juan Thornhill gone, the second projected starting spot turns to Ronnie Hickman. He has been solid in limited snaps, but they’ll want to add some assurance to the 
position.

You simply can’t build a competitive roster with the amount of money Deshaun Watson is being paid not to play quarterback. I don’t blame Cleveland for the decision they made to acquire him or 
the contract they gave him, but we are where we are. I can very easily understand the decision to draft Travis Hunter or Abdul Carter, and it appears that Hunter will be the pick.

Titans: `NFL Draft Preview: Titans
Picks: 1, 35, 103, 120, 141, 167, 178, 188

Needs: QB, WR, TE, IDL, EDGE, ILB, CB

QB: Cam Ward is going to be the Titans starting quarterback. This is a need by technicality.

WR: Outside of Calvin Ridley, this is a really thin group with Treylon Burks and Van Jefferson projected to start. They’ll want to add a weapon for their new QB early.

TE: Chig Okonkwo is a free agent after the season. They’ll want to either work on an extension or gain some clarity on the long-term plan at TE.

IDL: The Titans have two very important pieces in Jeffery Simmons and T’Vondre Sweat. Sebastian Joseph-Day projects as the third starter upfront, but he is 30 with an expiring contract. 
They’ll want to find a third piece long-term.

EDGE: There isn’t really a long-term piece in place here. I project Arden Key and Dre’Mont Jones to start this season, but both are on expiring contracts and nearing the end of their primes. 
This will be a focus of the draft and/or next offseason for Tennessee.

ILB: The Titans don’t have much opposite of Cody Barton. I project last year’s 4th-round pick Cedric Gray to start, but he didn’t play at all last season so he’s quite a wildcard.

CB: Last year’s 5th-round pick Jarvis Brownlee Jr. projects to be the 2nd starter on the outside. He really struggled last season, ranking as my #108 CB. Roger McCreary will man the Nickel, 
but he is on an expiring contract and also struggled last year.

The Titans have surrounded #1 pick Cam Ward with a strong offensive line. If they can add some receiving threats, they’ll have put him in a nice position to have early success. The defense is a 
work in progress, but the goal has to be putting Cam Ward in the most optimal position.
