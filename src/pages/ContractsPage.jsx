  These contract projections are built using a data-driven framework that evaluates player performance grades, age, and historical contract data to estimate future deals. 
  Projections are based on how comparable players performed prior to signing their past contracts â€” not how they look today. 
  I create a confidence band for each player using my own grading system alongside PFF grades, identifying high-end and low-end comps. 
  Rather than relying on raw AAV (Average Annual Value), all projections are scaled to cap % at signing â€” a more stable and predictive metric given year-to-year cap growth. 
  Final projections are calculated as a weighted combination of comparables within the confidence band, adjusted for position-specific trends, contract length norms, and market conditions.
