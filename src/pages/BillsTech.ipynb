    "\n",
    "– Most importantly, by far, were fumbles lost. The top 26 plays in -EPA were fumbles lost. The Eagles didn't lose a single fumble in the dataset. Of course, you removed interceptions which would also rank very highly. \n",
    "– 3rd Down Conversion Rate. The correlation between team winning % and 3rd down conversion rate was .375. There may be some bias in better teams converting at a higher rate, but I still think this is high enough to be noteworthy. The Eagles ranked 2nd in 3rd down conversions league-wide. \n",
    "– Explosive plays. 25 of the top 27 plays in EPA were long TDs. The Bills, Ravens, and Bengals all had mulitple of those 27 (not the Eagles, but 3 of the top offenses). \n"
